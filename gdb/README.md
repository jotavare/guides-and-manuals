246 Debugging with gdb
To issue a command to gdb without affecting certain aspects of the state which is seen
by users, prefix it with ‚Äòserver ‚Äô (see Section 28.2 [Server Prefix], page 356). This means
that this command will not affect the command history, nor will it affect gdb‚Äôs notion of
which command to repeat if RET is pressed on a line by itself.
The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the value history; to print
a value without recording it into the value history, use the output command instead of the
print command.
Here is the description of gdb commands related to command history.
set history filename fname
Set the name of the gdb command history file to fname. This is the file where
gdb reads an initial command history list, and where it writes the command
history from this session when it exits. You can access this list through history
expansion or through the history command editing characters listed below.
This file defaults to the value of the environment variable GDBHISTFILE, or to
‚Äò./.gdb_history‚Äô (‚Äò./_gdb_history‚Äô on MS-DOS) if this variable is not set.
set history save
set history save on
Record command history in a file, whose name may be specified with the set
history filename command. By default, this option is disabled.
set history save off
Stop recording command history in a file.
set history size size
Set the number of commands which gdb keeps in its history list. This defaults
to the value of the environment variable HISTSIZE, or to 256 if this variable is
not set.
History expansion assigns special meaning to the character !. See Section 32.1.1 [Event
Designators], page 385, for more details.
Since ! is also the logical not operator in C, history expansion is off by default. If you
decide to enable history expansion with the set history expansion on command, you may
sometimes need to follow ! (when it is used as logical not, in an expression) with a space
or a tab to prevent it from being expanded. The readline history facilities do not attempt
substitution on the strings != and !(, even when history expansion is enabled.
The commands to control history expansion are:
set history expansion on
set history expansion
Enable history expansion. History expansion is off by default.
set history expansion off
Disable history expansion.
Chapter 22: Controlling gdb 247
show history
show history filename
show history save
show history size
show history expansion
These commands display the state of the gdb history parameters. show
history by itself displays all four states.
show commands
Display the last ten commands in the command history.
show commands n
Print ten commands centered on command number n.
show commands +
Print ten commands just after the commands last printed
  
  
gdb program
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
gdb program core
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want to debug a
running process:
gdb program 1234
would attach gdb to process 1234 (unless you also have a file named ‚Äò1234‚Äô; gdb does check
for a core file first).
Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly complete op-
erating system; when you use gdb as a remote debugger attached to a bare board, there
may not be any notion of ‚Äúprocess‚Äù, and there is often no way to get a core dump. gdb
will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.
You can optionally have gdb pass any arguments after the executable file to the inferior
using --args. This option stops option processing.
gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
This will cause gdb to debug gcc, and to set gcc‚Äôs command-line arguments (see
Section 4.3 [Arguments], page 28) to ‚Äò-O2 -c foo.c‚Äô.
You can run gdb without printing the front material, which describes gdb‚Äôs
non-warranty, by specifying -silent:
gdb -silent

gdb -statistics
gdbtui gdb --tui 

$ gdb -q -tui <file>

Then when in gdb:

(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) layout asm
(gdb) layout reg
(gdb) list 10 
winheight src +4
winheight cmd
win win_name src cmd asm regs src
layout asm
layout split
layout regs
tui reg float
tui reg system
tui reg general
layout next
layout prev
layout src

b -> break
c -> continue
d -> delete
f -> frame
i -> info
j -> jump
l -> list
n -> next
p -> print
r -> run
s -> step
u -> until

There are also two or more letters, such as:

aw -> awatch
bt -> backtrace
dir -> directory
disas -> disassemble
fin -> finish
ig -> ignore
ni -> nexti
rw -> rwatch
si -> stepi
tb -> tbreak
wa -> watch
win -> winheight

  (gdb) shell ls

or

(gdb) !ls
